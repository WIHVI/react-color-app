# Guess the Color App

A React application I have build to get used more with the React functional components, useState, useEffect, where you need to guess the color by clicking on one of the three options, a green or red message will pop up on the screen telling you if the answer was correct or not.

If you want to test your RGB knowledge, give it a try. :)
